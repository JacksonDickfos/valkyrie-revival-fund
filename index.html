                <p>Valkyrie Revival is a new fund built by a core group of principals with shared execution experience, alongside senior leaders bringing decades of relevant experience from adjacent roles and sectors. Our experience spans private equity, technology, strategy and M&A, hands-on operational transformation, and institutional governance—enabling us to create durable value with speed and precision from otherwise illiquid or over-leveraged software companies.</p>
                <p>At the center of our platform is a proprietary operating system—a hybrid corporate intelligence framework designed to compress M&A, project, and operational timelines from months to hours and from weeks to minutes. This system is the backbone for how we evaluate opportunities, execute transactions, and drive ongoing performance across acquired businesses.</p>
                <p>The platform is reinforced by a network of specialists spanning technology M&A, portfolio company leadership, and institutional governance. The team brings deep experience across global markets, including North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East. The Fund's current geographic focus is North America, Europe, and the EU/UK, with investments outside these regions evaluated on a selective basis in light of economic and geopolitical considerations.</p>
                <p>Why Valkyrie? In Norse mythology, the Valkyrie chose which fallen warriors were still worthy of revival. We do the same—selecting overlooked software companies - reviving and scaling them into enduring, cash-generating assets.</p>

                <p>We hold 100% equity and control of each investment and operate without leverage or passive oversight. We fund and manage our portfolio companies directly, supporting them through a centralized shared-services platform. There are no industry advisory boards or external consultants—only direct accountability from the people running the business.</p>
