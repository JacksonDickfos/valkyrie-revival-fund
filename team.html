                        <p class="team-title">Global PE & AI Leadership</p>
                        <p class="team-role">General Partner</p>
                        <div class="team-description-container">
                            <p class="team-description">Chris Morino is the Founder and General Partner of the Valkyrie Revival Fund, a private equity platform built with the <a href="https://www.prytaneumpartners.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prytaneum Partners</a> to acquire and revive underperforming B2B software businesses through disciplined operations, strong governance, and a cash-first operating philosophy.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Chris's career has been shaped inside complex operating environments where outcomes were measured not in projections, but in customer retention, margin recovery, and execution under pressure. In prior senior operating roles, he led and operated multi-company software portfolios generating more than $130 million in annual revenue, and delivering sustained net operating margins ranging from approximately 75% to over 84% across complex, distressed software portfolios following periods of instability or underperformance.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">These results ranked in the top tier of global software operating benchmarks relative to comparable private-equity-owned portfolios, reflecting disciplined execution rather than leverage, multiple expansion, or transient cost suppression.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Across these environments, his mandate was consistent: stabilize operations, restore accountability, and reorient organizations around cash discipline, margin integrity, and customer value. While starting conditions varied, the sequencing of action did not—clarity before growth, governance before scale, and operating discipline before capital deployment.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Importantly, this level of performance was not the result of individual heroics. It reflected a repeatable operating culture built on disciplined teams, explicit accountability, and execution within well-defined governance constraints.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Chris is consistently described as calm under pressure and execution-first in leadership style, favoring clarity over charisma, cadence over urgency, and outcomes over optics. Decisions are shared before execution, ownership is explicit, and systems are designed so performance does not depend on any single individual. This leadership approach has proven durable in post-acquisition environments where timelines are compressed and errors compound quickly.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Chris has designed his operating approach around artificial intelligence from first principles rather than adopting it as a layer on top of legacy processes. AI is embedded into how work is performed across diligence, governance, operating diagnostics, and execution, so that every material task is built for automation and analytical leverage from the outset. This design eliminates low-value manual work, applies accumulated institutional knowledge continuously, and compresses analytical and execution timelines by an order of magnitude. Speed, in this context, is a consequence of system architecture and judgment discipline—human operators retain full authority and accountability, with AI expanding decision quality rather than replacing it.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">The Valkyrie Revival Fund inherits this operating culture directly. The platform is a formal extension of Chris's prior execution experience, deliberately structured for investors who prioritize capital protection, early cash yield, and predictable behavior over growth-at-any-cost strategies. Chris's role is not to speculate on outcomes, but to design and install systems capable of producing them at scale.</p>

                        <p class="team-role">Senior Partner, Capital & Investor Relations</p>
                        <div class="team-description-container">
                            <p class="team-description">Mark Sampson serves as Senior Partner, Capital & Fund Operations at the Valkyrie Revival Fund. He brings deep experience as a General Partner, having successfully raised and operated multiple private equity funds across market cycles. As a GP, Mark has led capital raises across five private equity funds and has been responsible for the structuring, capitalization, and deployment of more than $3 billion across debt and equity investments in lower middle market companies, spanning full fund lifecycles from formation through realization.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">At Valkyrie, Mark is responsible for capital strategy, LP engagement, and fund-level operations. He oversees fundraising execution, financial structuring, reporting rigor, and operational controls across the firm's fund platform, ensuring capital is governed with precision, transparency, and durability. His role anchors Valkyrie's ability to align institutional capital with an operating model built around discipline, cash generation, and predictable execution.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Mark's investment career has been shaped by environments where structure matters more than narrative and where flexibility is a prerequisite for durable outcomes. He has consistently focused on aligning capital providers with operating realities, favoring bespoke debt and equity solutions that accommodate operational sequencing, conservative leverage profiles, and management accountability. This philosophy reinforces Valkyrie's priority on downside protection, early cash yield, and institutional durability over growth-at-any-cost strategies.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">In parallel with his role at Valkyrie, Mark is the Founder and Managing Partner of Pacific Growth Investors, LLC ("PGI"), and previously founded Vintage Capital Partners in 2002. Across these platforms, he has held senior leadership roles at four successful private equity firms, overseeing underwriting, structuring, and portfolio governance for structured debt and equity investments across aerospace and defense, healthcare and medical devices, industrial manufacturing, software, and technology-enabled businesses.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Mark has held senior roles at Wells Fargo Bank and Union Bank, where he sourced middle market companies, structured senior debt securities, and managed loan portfolios. After earning his MBA from the Pepperdine Graziadio Business School, he joined Credit Suisse, managing global corporate debt transactions across multiple product groups, and later served at Credit Suisse First Boston as head of the West Coast credit product portfolio and a Vice President in the healthcare investment banking group.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">He currently serves on the boards of directors of Precision Motion Health, Originate, Inc., and Spectra Aerospace, and has previously served as Chairman of the Board and led business review and operating committees for multiple portfolio companies through periods of strategic and operational inflection.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Mark is a frequent speaker at leading industry and academic forums and has been recognized by the Los Angeles Business Journal and Los Angeles Times for leadership and influence in private equity, banking, and finance.</p>

                            <p class="team-description">Ian Miller serves as Senior Partner, Europe & Governance at the Valkyrie Revival Fund. He is a Chartered Accountant with more than 30 years of experience spanning strategy, M&A, performance improvement, and complex business turnarounds across Europe and North America, with a career defined by execution in highly regulated and capital-intensive environments.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">He spent fourteen years in strategy consulting and M&A, including serving as Global Practice Head for his sector, before leading operational transformations as CEO, Chairman, and Executive Vice President. His senior leadership experience includes roles at EDS, Hewlett-Packard, NTT Data, and two publicly listed companies on the London Stock Exchange, with deep exposure across insurance, healthcare, banking, and capital markets. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE).</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Across his career, Ian has led complex cross-border acquisitions, integrations, and restructurings where governance discipline and sequencing determined outcomes. He negotiated and executed the acquisition of ENIDATA, the IT services subsidiary of Italy's state energy company, by Electronic Data Systems (EDS) in two tranches totaling more than $1 million, and oversaw full post-acquisition integration.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">He has also executed strategic acquisitions designed to open regulated markets, including the acquisition of a UK public sector services company to establish Keane Inc.'s access to the UK Government market, followed by successful operational integration measured in sustained post-close performance rather than transaction mechanics.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Ian has led high-complexity corporate turnarounds in public market environments. He played a central role in the turnaround of Parity Group PLC, restoring growth and profitability after prolonged decline, and subsequently led an oversubscribed rights issue on the London Stock Exchange, recapitalizing the business and reestablishing market confidence.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Beyond transactions, Ian has operated at the system-design level. He led a two-year transformation program for Agip SpA, Italy's state oil company, redesigning long-range strategic planning to incorporate macroeconomic analysis, scenario planning, and competitor strategy, converting planning into a decision-support capability under volatile conditions.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Earlier, Ian led the turnaround of EDS's Global Energy business unit, increasing revenue by more than 300% and moving the unit from the lowest growth performer among more than 30 SBUs to the top three for growth, margin, and return on capital employed within three years through disciplined execution and capital allocation.</p>

                        <p class="team-role">Chief Information Officer</p>
                        <div class="team-description-container">
                            <p class="team-description">Jeff Moyer serves as Chief Information Officer at the Valkyrie Revival Fund. He brings more than 35 years of experience leading large-scale transformation across SaaS, cloud, artificial intelligence, and enterprise IT environments, with a career shaped by situations where outcomes were measured in margin recovery, operational stability, and execution under pressure rather than roadmap promises or technical novelty.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">At Valkyrie, Jeff partners with the General Partners to design and execute the firm's technology and operating systems. His work focuses on delivery optimization, cost rationalization, and the application of AI-driven operating models across Valkyrie-managed portfolios, producing outsized gains in operational quality and cost efficiency by aligning technology architecture directly with governance, cash discipline, and execution cadence.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Across corporate and private-equity-backed environments, Jeff has built and led global organizations of more than 1,000 employees, overseen multibillion-dollar portfolios, and delivered measurable improvements in profitability and operating efficiency across North America, EMEA, and APAC. His leadership spans P&L ownership, enterprise modernization, AI-first product strategy, and post-acquisition operational transformation.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Jeff currently serves as a Fractional C-Suite executive with Eight Aspects and Axsys.AI, partnering with enterprises and private equity firms to architect AI-driven modernization strategies from diligence through post-close integration. His work emphasizes eliminating technical debt, improving scalability, and translating technology decisions into cash, margin, and execution leverage rather than complexity. He also serves as an Advisor Member to Furman University's Strategic AI Program, supporting organizations advancing AI adoption and digital maturity.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Previously, as CEO of Skyvera, Jeff led multiple acquisitions and executed complex turnarounds in distressed software environments. He converted a –36% margin software division into +42% margins within six months and transformed a bankrupt SaaS business from –146% margins to +51% in under nine months, scaling the company to $20 million in annual revenue. During this period, he set Skyvera's AI-first product direction, embedding generative AI capabilities that reduced manual work by more than 60% and increased customer satisfaction by 35%.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Earlier, as President and CEO of Luminoso Technologies, Jeff increased ARR by 30% while reducing monthly burn from $2 million to under $750,000 through disciplined restructuring and go-to-market realignment. At Rackspace Technology, he launched six new multi-cloud services across AWS, Azure, and GCP within twelve months, driving a full year of double-digit sales growth.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Jeff has also held senior executive roles at Rackspace Technology, DXC Technology, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Electronic Data Systems (EDS), where he led cloud transformation programs that improved operational efficiency by 40%, reduced costs by 30%, and shifted $120 million in annual spend to consumption-based cloud economics. Earlier in his career, he served as a U.S. Army Sergeant and was recognized as United States Army Europe Soldier of the Year.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Jeff holds a degree in Business Administration from Penn State University and is published in multiple industry outlets. He is consistently recognized for combining the rigor of a CTO with the commercial instincts of an operator and investor—designing technology systems that function as durable operating advantages rather than cost centers.</p>

                        <p class="team-role">Vice President, Strategic Operations</p>
                        <div class="team-description-container">
                            <p class="team-description">Jackson Dickfos serves as Vice President, Strategic Operations at the Valkyrie Revival Fund. He works closely with the General Partners across AI-driven transformation initiatives, go-to-market execution, and commercial turnarounds with a mandate centered on translating operating strategy into repeatable execution systems.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Jackson's career has been shaped by building, fixing, and scaling revenue and operating models where outcomes were measured in cash conversion, execution velocity, and durability rather than narrative growth. He brings a powerful hybrid background as a technology founder and commercial operator, combining hands-on product construction with disciplined sales, pricing, and go-to-market execution.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">As a founder, Jackson has won two global accelerators and built multiple venture-backed platforms from first principles. He solely designed and built the core technology behind Fuel Your Life, Oceania's largest dietetics company, later exiting in an eight-figure transaction.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Across senior operating roles, Jackson has led product, sales, and go-to-market teams in both high-growth startups and $1B+ enterprises alike, often in turnaround or scale-transition environments. He has pioneered and executed industry-first bulk sponsorship structures with publicly listed companies including CBRE and RFG, and built the world's first end-to-end sponsorship marketplace, converting fragmented sponsorship activity into a scalable commercial channel.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">A defining element of Jackson's approach is the application of artificial intelligence as operating infrastructure rather than tooling. He has implemented AI systems across revenue operations, customer workflows, and contractually consults on AI deployment for publicly listed companies. In parallel, he's helped Fortune 500 companies reduce cloud spend by eight figures, aligning architecture, usage discipline, and governance to eliminate structural waste.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Jackson has experience on both sides of the M&A lifecycle, having been involved in multiple exits as a founder and working directly with investors and operators to reposition businesses that had stagnated in their original markets. Following acquisitions, he has visited customers, partners, and newly integrated teams across 40 countries, building trust, ensuring continuity, and stabilizing operations during periods of transition.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">In addition to his role at Prytaneum, Jackson serves as an advisor and mentor to businesses across Europe and Oceania. He is consistently recognized for combining founder-level ownership with institutional operating discipline—approaching AI, growth, and go-to-market strategy as execution systems rather than functions, and prioritizing durability over acceleration.</p>
