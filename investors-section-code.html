                <h3>A fund structure designed for capital efficiency and compounding</h3>
                <p class="card-preview">We have deliberately re-examined the traditional private equity model with the objective of reducing capital drag and improving capital efficiency. Management fees are structured to be supported by operating cash flows rather than LP capital, resulting in higher capital intensity directed toward acquisitions. LP capital is deployed to establish the initial portfolio, with the model designed such that incremental growth may be supported by cash generated within the fund, enhancing capital efficiency over time.</p>

                <h3>Focused leadership with full accountability</h3>
                <p class="card-preview">A highly experienced, operator-led team with a single mandate and direct responsibility for outcomes. There is no strategy drift and no diffusion of control—just disciplined execution by the principals who run the businesses they acquire.</p>

                <h3>Early cash generation with compounding return characteristics</h3>
                <p class="card-preview">The strategy emphasizes cash generation early in the investment cycle, with distributions and reinvestment supported by operating performance rather than leverage or deferred exits. Returns are driven by margin expansion, cost discipline, and operational optimization, producing recurring cash flows with compounding characteristics over multi-year holding periods.</p>

                <p class="card-preview">Regulatory accountability, strong governance, and embedded controls at both the portfolio and fund level.

                <h3>Alignment with real-world outcomes</h3>
                <p class="card-preview">A model designed to restore economic viability to underperforming software businesses, with a focus on long-term sustainability across our customers and our stakeholders.</p>
